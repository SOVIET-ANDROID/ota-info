Device:
Kernel V3.12 state:
- FOD optimization which slightly improves performance and more so improves performance consistency
- power: charge performance fixes (including screen off pd)
- block: improvements
- power efficiency improvements
- config: correct initial kprofile performance mode to resolve boot time regression
- kprofiles: restrict latency sensitive and boosted uclamp flags on battery mode
  - This also results in disabled Walt colocation (which uses these flags) for additionally improved power efficiency at a performance cost

Device:
Drop QCOM perf, use only in kernel solutions -- significantly improves battery
Fix previous mistake with uclamp init defaults
Kernel: v3.24 state:
- Power efficiency improvements
- Walt/kprofiles: improve battery and performance kprofile mode migration margins
- sched/kprofiles: only bump min uclamp on non battery mode
- dc dim: fix fod press dim tuning
- single tap: delay single tap gesture and make cancelable
  - allows OOS like behavior with single tap to ambient, so initial double tap still wakes device
- fod: another small set of optimizations
